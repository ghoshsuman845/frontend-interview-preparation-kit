### Week 1 : Brushing up HTML, CSS, JS!

```
Day-wise Schedule:

Day 1: Revise HTML in 0.5 day or less than that. Start with CSS theory revision.
Day 2: Practise the CSS questions on bfe.dev
Day 3-4: Watch Namaste JS playlist for a refresher. This will take two days as there are good amount of videos, it's always good if you can complete it in less time.
Day 5-7: Focus on other topics that weren't covered in the playlist. Practise the polyfills by coding them yourself, not just on the notebook but also on the laptop.

### Week 2 : Practice Time!

Remember `Practise makes a man perfect`? So, this week we will focus on practising conceptual questions and making basic applications in JS.

Practise on the following links step by step:
 - [Leetcode 30 days of JS](https://leetcode.com/studyplan/30-days-of-javascript/)
 - Start with Easy questions, then Medium and Hard : [GreatFrontend JS Problems](https://www.greatfrontend.com/prepare/coding) : [Solutions](https://github.com/ghoshsuman845/GreatFrontendSolutions)
 - [BigFrontEnd Javascript Problems](https://bigfrontend.dev/problem)

Above mentioned resources are more than enough for practising Javascript questions. Now comes the turn of `practising by making some small applications in HTML, CSS, JS`. Such type of questions are generally asked in `Machine Coding` rounds.

Adding below a list of small applications that you can practise:
  - Star Rating
  - Implementing Flipkart Search bar functionality using debouncing or throttle
  - Typeahead/ autocomplete search bar
  - Todo List (Having CRUD operations)
  - Creating components like Carousel , Accordian, Popover
  - Infinite Scroll
  - Implement tic tac toe
  - Create Images gallery(Use optimations like infinite scroll, pagination, search functionality)
  - Implement a poll widget
  - Implement a Event Emitter
  - Implement a Kanban board having tasks and subtasks
  - Creating a basic Chat Application
  - Implement Comment Widget (add comments, add multiple replies to comments and delete them like Facebook or Instagram)
  - Food Ordering App having Search, Sort, Filter, Add to Cart functionality
  - Build a calculator (add/subtract... then multiply/divide... then log/pow... etc)
  - Create a progress bar having start/restart, pause, stop functionality
  - Create Analog Clock
  - Implement Day Calendar
  - Create a Todo List using Drag and Drop

  `Note`: 
  - You need not practise all the questions mentioned above, skip the questions you think you'll be able to solve confidently and pick the once that you feel hesitant about. 
  - `Practise everything by coding on laptop` as this will not just help in learning but would also `make you confident` and would `increase your coding speed` while you're interviewing.

### Week 4 : Time to do some System Design!

Listing some best resources for studying System Design in Frontend, go on and binge watch them:

 - [Front-End Engineer YT Channel](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5vyKhm2NTfw&list=PLI9W87-Dqn7j_x6QtR6sUjycJR7nQLBqT)
 - [Chirag Goel YT Channel](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sV_4pOGosnU&list=PL4CFloQ4GGWICE0Tz6iXKfN3XWkXRlboU)
 - [BigFrontend Frontend Design Questions](https://bigfrontend.dev/design)
 - [GreatFrontend Design Questions](https://www.greatfrontend.com/system-design)

 The above resources will help you in understanding the way you can deal with System Design rounds, although these solutions are not the only ones, you can come up with your own ideas as well. Also, different interviewers have different expectations when they ask you to provide a design for any system, no solution is the best/concrete solution in that case, however you can follow this pattern for framing your answers:

 - [GreatFrontend System Design Framework](https://www.greatfrontend.com/system-design/framework)


### Week 5 : Reading React Docs and Practising!
Brush up your react by reading React docs and making some small apps in react.

 Study all the hooks from [React docs](https://react.dev/reference/react):
  - useState()
  - useEffect()
  - useCallback()
  - useMemo()
  - useRef()
  - useReducer()
  - useContext()
  - useId()
  - useLayoutEffect()

  Other important topics:
  - [What is the virtual DOM in React?](https://blog.logrocket.com/virtual-dom-react/)
  - [Optimising performance of React App](https://blog.logrocket.com/optimizing-performance-react-app/)
  - [Reconciliation, Diffing, Batch Update in React](https://youtu.be/rysTbzKOEO0?si=elH9rty-FKrOFwO2)
  - [React Lifecycle Hooks](https://www.freecodecamp.org/news/react-component-lifecycle-methods/)
  - [Custom Hooks Practise Questions](https://bigfrontend.dev/react)
  - [React Quizes](https://bigfrontend.dev/react-quiz)
  - [React Patterns](https://reactpatterns.com/)
  - [React Cheatsheet](https://devhints.io/react)
  - [React by Example](https://reactbyexample.github.io/getting-started)
  - [React Handbook](https://reacthandbook.com/)
  - [React Coding Challenges](https://reactchallenges.live/dashboard/overview)


### Week 6 : Get you hands dirty by practising some DSA questions!

Not many companies ask DSA questions for Frontend Engineer roles, but for the sake of some good companies which have DSA rounds and for practise too, you can follow the following two resources:

  - [Blind 75 Leetcode Questions](https://leetcode.com/discuss/general-discussion/460599/blind-75-leetcode-questions) : [Solutions](https://github.com/ghoshsuman845/Blind-75-Leetcode-Solution-In-JS)

  Once you are done with the above, practise more `Arrays` and `Strings` questions: 
  - [Leetcode Array Interview Questions](https://leetcode.com/problemset/all/?listId=wpwgkgt&page=1&topicSlugs=array)
  - [Leetcode Strings Interview Questions](https://leetcode.com/problemset/all/?listId=wpwgkgt&page=1&topicSlugs=string)
  - [Leetcode Sorting Interview Questions](https://leetcode.com/problemset/all/?listId=wpwgkgt&page=1&topicSlugs=sorting)
  - [Leetcode JS Interview Problems](https://leetcode.com/problemset/javascript/)

  ### Tips:

  - Whenever starting with a new topic, don't just read from one resource, try to read atleast 10 articles surrounding that topic from [Medium](https://medium.com/)/other websites.
  - Always try to understand the `What, Why and How's?(What is the topic about? Why is it used? How to use/implement it?)` of a topic with an example of it. This gives you a fair and required idea about the topic. You can also take a real time coding implementation of that topic which will give you the best understanding of the topic, rest of the clarity comes with experience and practise.😌
